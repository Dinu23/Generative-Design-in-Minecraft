# Generative Design in Minecraft

## Overview

This project focuses on the use of advanced procedural content generation techniques within the Minecraft environment, particularly by integrating concepts from **Procedural Content Generation via Machine Learning (PCGML)**. The goal is to autonomously create unique and optimized structures, landscapes, and other in-game elements that adapt to various gameplay scenarios.

## Features

- **Procedural Content Generation (PCG)**: Automatic creation of complex structures and landscapes using rule-based systems and randomization techniques.
- **Customizable Generation Parameters**: Adjust various parameters like the complexity of structures, terrain types, and other factors influencing the generative process.
- **Minecraft Integration**: Seamless interaction with the Minecraft environment, enabling real-time generation and manipulation of in-game elements based on the PCGML framework.



## Key Components

### 1. Procedural Generation
- **Overview**: Uses predefined rules, randomness, and machine learning models to create structures and landscapes.
- **Applications**: Can generate diverse terrains, buildings, or other elements within the Minecraft world.

### 2. Minecraft Integration
- **Overview**: Direct integration with Minecraft allows for the immediate application of generated content, providing a dynamic and evolving game environment.
- **Applications**: Real-time testing and visualization of generated designs in the game.
